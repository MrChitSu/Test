  I heard a happy word from my dear Mama Kay Thwe.  He made a promise, and so did I.  These promises were made by Telegram.  These words were recorded with a screenshot photo.</p> <hr>

 I will always remember the days when I told my mother that I had won the first poetry competition in the township in seventh grade, and the days when I saw her happy smile and the days when I heard the promise of Mama Kay Thwe were the most memorable days of my life.  I am also grateful for the destiny that created the bond with my loved one for life.  I will cherish it as much as I do.
